## The Rock Wechter

**Project Overview:**
This project is a simple replica of the Rock Wechter website, designed to showcase the lineup of artists scheduled to perform at the festival. It features a countdown timer at the top to build anticipation for the event, followed by a lineup section where users can view all the artists set to rock the stage.

**Project Scope:**

**Countdown Timer:** 
Positioned prominently atop the page, a pulsating countdown timer serves as a beacon of anticipation, drawing users into the rhythmic fervor building up to the event.
Lineup Showcase: Below the countdown, a dedicated lineup section unfolds, inviting users to explore the stellar ensemble of artists set to ignite the stage with their musical prowess.

**Technical Elements:**
Driven by a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project seamlessly integrates functionality and aesthetics. From the countdown timer to the presentation of the artist lineup.

**Disclaimer:**
The Rock Wechter project is a creation intended for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only.
