## The School of Talent Project

**Project Overview:**
At "The School of Talent," we conceptualized a haven where individuals grappling with picky eating habits could find solace and guidance. My initiative centered around crafting a curriculum tailored to the tastes and preferences of these individuals, fostering a sense of culinary adventure through dishes rooted in familiarity.

**Website Structure:**
The website was meticulously structured across multiple pages to ensure a seamless user experience:
- **Home**
- **Curriculum** 
- **About**
- **Enroll**
  - **Test**
  - **Welcome**
  - **Form**
- **Error**

**Impact and Vision:**
Through "The School of Talent" project, I aimed to not only showcase technical proficiency but also to underscore the power of creativity and inclusivity in educational endeavors. By addressing the unique needs of fussy eaters, I sought to foster a culture of culinary exploration and empower individuals to embrace a diverse array of flavors and ingredients.


**Disclaimer:**
The School of Talent project is a fictional creation intended for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only.
