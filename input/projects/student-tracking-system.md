## Student Tracking System

**Concept Overview:**
The Student Tracking System (Student Volgsysteem in NL) is designed to comprehensively monitor students' journeys through their education, capturing their progress in lectures, practical sessions, coaching, and workplace learning. This system enables teachers, learning coaches, program coaches, diversity coaches, and team leaders to track and assess students effectively, facilitating an inclusive and structured educational experience.

**Key Features:**

- **Attendance and Participation Tracking:** Easily record attendance and evaluate student engagement across various learning environments.
- **Performance Assessment:** Monitor academic performance and evaluate students’ progress on assignments and practical tasks.
- **Coaching Documentation:** Document and access coaching sessions, offering tailored guidance and tracking developmental milestones.
- **Comprehensive Status Overview:** Maintain an up-to-date view of each student’s educational status, streamlining communication among educational staff.
- **Collaborative Development:** Built for Arteveldehogeschool, the system was developed collaboratively by a four-member team, with project management, back-end development, and GitHub Projects task management led by me.

**Development Notes:** The project was a team effort, where I managed back-end tasks, coordinated merge requests, and served as the primary client contact, ensuring smooth execution and clear communication throughout the development process.

**Disclaimer:**
The Student Tracking System project is a creation intended for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes only.
